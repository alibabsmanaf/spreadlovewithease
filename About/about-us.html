        <strong>Our Story:</strong> Our journey began 05/Feb/2023. It started
        with a small group of dedicated individuals who were passionate about
        making a difference in the lives of children facing adversity. Over the
        years, we have grown into a loving community that opens its doors to
        those in need.

        <strong>What Drives Us:</strong> We are driven by a deep sense of
        compassion and the belief that every child, regardless of their
        circumstances, should have the opportunity to dream, learn, and grow.
